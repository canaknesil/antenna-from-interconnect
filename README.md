## Directory Structure

`fpga`: FPGA design of the transmitter and the antennas.

`software`: Software to create the data frame intended to be sent by the transmitter, to perform demodulation and analysis, and to get the necessary information to calculate routing resource utilization.

`example`: The workflow guide `example/workflow.md` together with an example set of intermediate and output files generated during the workflow.
